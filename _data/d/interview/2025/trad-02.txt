Kasuga Moeka: This is 79.5 NACK5, "Fantasy Radio," hosted by Kasuga Moeka. In this segment, we welcome wonderful guests from various genres. Today, we have Hika and Natsu from the four-member girl band NEK!, who released their second EP, "Trick Taking," on March 5th. Good evening!

Hika: Good evening.

Natsu: Good evening.

Kasuga Moeka: Let's start with introductions.

Hika: I'm Hika, guitar and vocals. Nice to meet you.

Natsu: I'm Natsu, guitar. Nice to meet you.

Kasuga Moeka: Nice to meet you both. Thank you for dressing up so stylishly for the show. You're both really putting in the effort today! Can I call you Hika-chan?

Hika: Yes, please do.

Kasuga Moeka: Hika-chan, you're wearing a full red outfit. Red, red!

Hika: Yeah.

Kasuga Moeka: Thank you! And I see you have a black bob, but with a peek of pink underneath! So cute! And the sparkly hair roots! So cute!

Hika: Thank you so much.

Kasuga Moeka: And Natsu-san, you're dressed like you've won some kind of spring fashion contest!

Natsu: I wanted to incorporate a bit of spring into my look.

Kasuga Moeka: Your pink hair is also very cute!

Natsu: It's freshly dyed.

Kasuga Moeka: Thank you both for dressing up! Today, I'd like to talk about NEK! with you two. Since this is our first time meeting, let's start with your profiles. NEK! is a four-member girl band consisting of Hika-san, Natsu-san, Kanade-san on bass, and Cocoro-san on drums. You all started by sharing your music on YouTube and social media, and then formed the band in February 2024 after being impressed by each other's performances. Is it true you discovered each other online?

Hika: Yes, that's right.

Natsu: Yes.

Kasuga Moeka: So, you both knew each other through online platforms?

Hika: I was doing solo music activities on social media, and I wanted to start a rock band. So, I searched for members on YouTube and Instagram.

Natsu: Yes.

Kasuga Moeka: Honestly, Natsu-san doesn't give off a rock vibe at all. You look very elegant. But Hika-san, you don't seem like the typical rock band type either.

Hika: That's true. It's completely different from what I used to do.

Natsu: That's right. But she transforms when she sings. That's her charm.

Kasuga Moeka: After listening to your second EP, I'm still trying to reconcile the image of you two with the music.

Hika: I know, right? When I first saw Natsu-chan on YouTube, I was like, "How can someone so cute play such fast guitar riffs?" I was immediately drawn to her. I knew I had to invite her.

Natsu: And when I heard Hika's voice on TikTok, I was instantly captivated. I thought, "How happy would I be to play guitar behind this vocalist?"

Hika: You've never said that before!

Natsu: I'm almost crying!

Kasuga Moeka: I can see the hearts floating around you two! So, NEK! is named after the internet slang "Aneki," which means "a reliable older sister." You're a girl band born from the internet.

Hika, Natsu: Yes.

Kasuga Moeka: With rock as your base and internet-inspired lyrics, you're also known as a "slang rock band." Your latest EP really showcases that.

Hika: Thank you.

Kasuga Moeka: How was the live performance?

Hika: It was amazing!

Natsu: It was so much fun! We played at Final West, and it was sold out. We saw an incredible view.

Hika, Natsu: We really did.

Kasuga Moeka: And now you're here, even bigger than before!

Hika: Thank you.

Kasuga Moeka: NEK! is written as "NEK!" with an exclamation mark. And your EP, "Trick Taking!" also has an exclamation mark. Despite your gentle demeanor, your album is very intense.

Hika: Very intense.

Natsu: We're going all out.

Kasuga Moeka: With tapping guitar riffs and pounding bass drums, and Hika-san's rapid-fire lyrics. It's an amazing EP! Let's listen to a track. Hika-san, your voice is very cute, but the lyrics are so relatable. How do you all create your songs?

Hika: We start by jamming together in the studio to create the basic structure, and then we work with writers to refine it.

Kasuga Moeka: Listening to the lyrics, I noticed they touch on the constant online conflicts and negativity. It made me feel uncomfortable, but also a bit self-conscious. Is the internet a central theme for your songs?

Natsu: Yes. As a band born from the internet, it's a crucial theme for us. We want to express ourselves in a way that only NEK! can, and writing about our thoughts on the internet feels unique. We're focusing a lot on that in our songwriting.

Kasuga Moeka: Natsu-san, what about the music? What did you focus on?

Natsu: We really focus on creating riffs that stick in your ear. Especially in "Zero-Sum," the opening slap bass and guitar riff are designed to be memorable.

Kasuga Moeka: I love the part in "Zero-Sum" where the vocals suddenly drop out. It's so cool!

Hika: It is!

Natsu: That part's great.

Kasuga Moeka: And the way the first and second times have slightly different chaotic sounds is really good. And the first time, you say "3-2-1."

Hika: Yes.

Natsu: Hika put a lot of thought into that part.

Hika: 3-2-1.

Kasuga Moeka: I recommend listeners pay close attention to that part. Let's play "Zero-Sum" from your second EP, "Trick Taking." Hika-san, please introduce the song.

Hika: This is NEK! with "Zero-Sum."

--- Playing Zero-Sum ---

Kasuga Moeka: That was NEK! with "Zero-Sum." So cool! It's really heavy rock.

Hika: Very heavy.

Kasuga Moeka: But you two are so cute. Is that NEK!'s charm?

Hika: I'm glad you think so.

Kasuga Moeka: The EP is full of details. You mentioned creating the songs together. For example, "Lona" has very sad lyrics over a heavy rock sound.

Hika: Yes.

Natsu: Yes.

Kasuga Moeka: "People crying every night" is a very sad line. And the song starts with "fingertips connected by timelines," which is very relevant today. It talks about how we crave connection, but still feel lonely. And "Moon" is another song I really like.

Hika, Natsu: Thank you!

Kasuga Moeka: It starts slow, almost like a ballad, and then builds up. And the line "in a world full of filters" is so beautiful. It contrasts the artificiality of social media with the natural, unchanging moon. It's a great contrast between the organic and inorganic.

Hika: Wow, you analyzed it so deeply! I was worried you might have found something negative. I'm so happy!

Natsu: We really put a lot of thought into the lyrics.

Hika: We're glad you noticed.

Natsu: And that you understand it.

Hika: Thank you, we're really happy.

Kasuga Moeka: Let's talk about "Fool." The lyrics are very relatable, about feeling constantly watched and judged.

Hika: Yes.

Kasuga Moeka: It's about how there's no escape. Even if you make a small mistake, someone might record it and post it online, and your life could be ruined. It's about that constant pressure to be perfect.

Natsu: This song is inspired by people who present a perfect image online, but have a completely different persona in real life. It's about how no one is truly perfect.

Kasuga Moeka: Right. Everyone has a hidden side.

Natsu: Yes.

Kasuga Moeka: So, your songs offer a lot of different ways to enjoy them. You can focus on the rock sound, or you can relate to the lyrics. I hope many people listen to it. Time is running out, but could you tell us about your upcoming activities?

Hika: Yes. First, we've been talking about it throughout the show, but our second EP, "Trick Taking," is now on sale. It's packed with five songs that represent the current NEK! We hope everyone, including those who are interested after listening to this, will give it a listen. Please buy it! Thank you! Also, on August 30th, Saturday, we'll be having our first ZEPP one-man live, "NEK! Kaiwai Z Kaku San Chu" at Shinjuku. Please come and join us! We're also posting daily content on our social media. Please check out our videos! For more details, please check our social media.

Kasuga Moeka: Could you each give a message to our listeners?

Natsu: Thank you so much for having us. It was a great pleasure. We'll continue to be active, so please check our social media and come to our live shows. Thank you so much!

Kasuga Moeka: Thank you.

Hika: We've released our EP, "Trick Taking." We hope you'll listen and enjoy it. Please continue to support NEK! Thank you for having us today.

Kasuga Moeka: Hika-san, thank you. We'll end with one more song. Please introduce it.

Hika: This is NEK! with "Dreams!!!!"

Kasuga Moeka: This has been "Fantasy Radio." My guests today were Hika-san and Natsu-san from NEK! Thank you!

Hika, Natsu: Thank you!
