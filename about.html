      <p>This site was created with two main starting goals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have a place to store details of the Japanese lyrics. My japanese is
          pretty poor, but I like to try to get a better understanding of the
          original lyrics, to go farther than the sometime so-so English version.
          I might as well share the resources I am using.
        </li>
        <li>Provide a place with some information about the band. There is no main
          page for the band at this point. I found this quite frustrating when I
          started to look for information about Nek!.<br/>
          So I started to add a bit of basic information about the band and their
          music<br/>
          ... then it got a bit out of hand üòÅ
