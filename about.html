<h2>What is this site</h2>
<div class="about-section">
  <p>This site was created with two main starting goals:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Have a place to store details of the Japanese lyrics. My japanese is
      pretty poor, but I like to try to get a better understanding of the
      original lyrics, to go farther than the sometime so-so English version.
      I might as well share the resources I am using.
    </li>
    <li>Provide a place with some information about the band. There is no main
      page for the band at this point. I found this quite frustrating when I
      started to look for information about NEK!.<br/>
      So I started to add a bit of basic information about the band and their
      music<br/>
      ... then it got a bit out of hand üòÅ
    </li>
  </ul>
