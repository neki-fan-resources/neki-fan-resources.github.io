      「NEK! DEBUT YEAR LAST LIVE」無事終了しました！
      お越しくださった皆様本当にありがとうございました🔥
      
      8月19日に年内ラストワンマンをシャングリラでできることになっていつも応援してくれている皆さんにすぐお知らせしましたが、それと同時に、え…？あのキャパ埋められるのかな…？という不安も押し寄せていて、正直ここ数日までその不安は消えていませんでした。
      
      でもライブが始まり幕が開いた瞬間、その不安は嘘のように吹き飛びました。
      超満員のシャングリラ。どこを見ても私たちのファンで埋め尽くされている。
      
      これが私たちの見たかった景色だ、、と心から思いました。
      
      今まで私たちがやってきたライブハウスの中ではダントツで大きい会場だったので、こちらから見る景色はひとまわりもふたまわりも違って見えました。
      
      ライブ中、視線をどこに移しても今年ライブで幾度となくお会いしたファンの方たちと目が合って、まるで今年の走馬灯を観ている感覚に陥りました笑
      
      今年作った楽曲たち全曲やりましたが、どれもいい曲だな、、と改めて実感。
      私はプレイヤーとしてもリスナーとしてもNEK!の楽曲が大好きなので、演奏しているときの感情は幸せ以外の何物でもありません。
      
      ライブでは何度もやっているけどまだ音源化していない楽曲もたくさんあるから、今後のリリースを楽しみにしててもらえたら嬉しいです☺️
      
      定番の曲はもちろん、初披露の曲も盛り上がってくれてて嬉しかったです！
      MAZE前のセッションコーナーかっこよかったでしょ？😎
      
      今回のワンマンではアコースティックコーナーもやりました！
      moon、Blink、令現少女の3曲を披露させていただいたのですが、アコースティックver.としてみんなで話し合って元々の曲構成からアレンジを加えたりして、また一味違ったNEK!を楽しんでもらえたかな？と思っています。
      
      私実はカホンをやったことがなくて、今月から始めたので、色々おぼつかないところもあったと思うのですが、なんとか形になってよかったです😂
      みんなで目合わせて呼吸合わせて演奏するあの感じめっちゃ楽しかった〜！！またいつかできたらいいな🌿
      
      これは完全に個人的なことになってしまうのですが、実は一週間前から風邪を引いてしまっていて、熱は下がったけど鼻水がまだ止まらない状態でのライブだったので、MCとかも所々聴き取りにくい部分あったかもしれません、、！
      本当に申し訳ありませんでした🥲(ライブ中もずーっと鼻すすりまくってたからもしマイクに音乗っちゃってたら本当にすみません)
      
      毎年この時期になったら言ってるけど、体調管理って本当に大事だなというのを再確認しました！！プロドラマーたるもの体調管理は基本中の基本！！
      
      皆さんもまだまだ寒い日続くので健康第一でお過ごしくださいね(誰が言うてんねん)
      
      今年は人生でいちばんライブができた年でした。
      NEK!と出会えて、そしてNEK!を応援してくれるファンの方とも出会えて、最高に幸せな一年だったな。
      
      そして周りの方の支えがなくては一年間走りきることはできませんでした。本当にありがとうございます。今年も大変お世話になりました！！！
      
      こんな素敵な2024年の締めくくりとなる今回の年末ワンマン、皆さんのおかげで最高のライブとなりました！！本当にありがとう！！
      
      来年は更にバンドも個人も成長した姿を見せられるように頑張っていきますので、2025年もよろしくお願いいたします🐍🤍🔥
      
      それでは、良いお年をお迎えください！

      2024.12.29
      
      "NEK! DEBUT YEAR LAST LIVE" has successfully concluded!
      To everyone who came, thank you so much🔥
      
      On August 19th, when it was decided we could do our final one-man live of the year at Shangri-La, I immediately let all of you who always support us know. At the same time, I was hit by a wave of anxiety, thinking... Eh? Can we fill a venue that size...? To be honest, that anxiety didn't disappear until just a few days ago.
      
      But the moment the live started and the curtain opened, that anxiety was blown away like it was never there.
      A packed Shangri-La. No matter where I looked, it was filled with our fans.
      
      I thought from the bottom of my heart, "This is the view we wanted to see..."
      
      Since it was by far the largest venue among the live houses we've played at so far, the scenery from our side looked completely different.
      
      During the live, no matter where I moved my gaze, I locked eyes with fans I've met countless times at shows this year, and it felt like I was watching a revolving lantern of this year's memories lol.
      
      We played every single song we created this year, and I realized once again what great songs they are.
      As both a player and a listener, I love NEK!'s music so much that my emotions while performing are nothing but happiness.
      
      There are many songs we've played live many times but haven't officially released yet, so I'd be happy if you look forward to future releases☺️
      
      I was glad that the standard songs, as well as the newly debuted ones, were so exciting!
      The session corner before MAZE was cool, wasn't it?😎
      
      We also did an acoustic corner for this one-man live!
      We performed three songs—moon, Blink, and Reigen Shoujo. As an acoustic version, we all discussed it and added arrangements to the original song structures. I hope you were able to enjoy a slightly different flavor of NEK!.
      
      Actually, I had never played the cajon before and only started this month, so I think there were some shaky parts, but I'm glad it took shape somehow😂
      That feeling of making eye contact and breathing together while performing was so much fun!! I hope we can do it again someday🌿
      
      This is a completely personal matter, but I actually caught a cold a week ago. Although my fever went down, I was performing with a runny nose that wouldn't stop, so there might have been parts of the MC that were hard to hear...!
      I am truly sorry🥲 (I was sniffing the whole time during the live, so I'm really sorry if that sound got picked up by the mic.)
      
      I say this every year around this time, but I reconfirmed that health management is truly important!! For a professional drummer, health management is the most basic of basics!!
      
      Everyone, the cold days will continue, so please prioritize your health (look who's talking).
      
      This year was the year I was able to play the most lives in my life.
      Meeting NEK!, and meeting the fans who support NEK!, it was a supremely happy year.
      
      And I wouldn't have been able to run through this year without the support of those around me. Thank you truly. You've been a great help this year!!!
      
      This year-end one-man live, which serves as a wonderful conclusion to 2024, became the best show thanks to all of you!! Thank you truly!!
      
      Next year, I will do my best so that I can show you how much both the band and I have grown, so please look forward to working with us in 2025 too🐍🤍🔥
      
      Well then, have a happy new year!

      12/29『NEK! DEBUT YEAR LAST LIVE』
      ＠ 下北沢シャングリラ
      
      ライブ納めありがとうございました。
      ストラップが外れてベースを落としかけた初ライブ時からは考えられない景色を見れてびっくりしたし、嬉しくてたまにウルっと来てました。笑
      (足元にセトリ置いてたのに、2回も構成ミスってHikaちゃんに迷惑かけたおバカさんです。)
      
      そして、2024年も活動を暖かく見守って下さってありがとうございました。
      
      2024年3月7日から始動したNEK!ですが、それまで1人SNSで活動をしていました。
      ベースを始めた中学生の頃からずっと、「誰かのベースを始めるきっかけになりたい。」という1つの夢があります。
      その夢を叶えるために、人前で演奏することにとても憧れを抱いていました。
      だからずっと、「バンドを組んでみたい。」と強く思っていました。
      今まで、バンドが組みたくて頑張ってみたけど上手くいかないこともあって。
      でも、バンドが組めないからって何もせずいるのもイヤだと思って、SNSの活動を始めようと心に決めました。
      弾いてみたを中心に動画をアップし始めて、見てくれる方もだんだんと増えてきて嬉しかったです。
      
      頑張っていく中で数字ばかりを気にして、好きなはずのベースが楽しめなかったりと辛い時期もありましたが
      とても暖かく、嬉しいコメントをくださる方がいたので頑張れました。
      その中でも「かなでさんをきっかけでベースを始めました。」と言ってくださる方もいて、この活動を通して1つの夢が叶ってとても嬉しかったです。
      
      SNSを頑張っている中で、カメラを通してじゃなく
      直接、生で、ステージの上に立って音楽を届けたいという思いがより一層強くなり、「やっぱりバンドやってみたいな。」と。
      そう思っていた矢先に、NEK!のみんなに出会えました。
      NEK!はSNSをきっかけに巡り会えたメンバーだから、今まで活動を頑張ってきて良かった。
      これからもよろしくね。
      
      いつも応援してくださっていた方とも、SNSのコメント上でしかお話ができなかったので、
      実際に会うことができて、お話をすることができて、本当に本当に嬉しかったです。
      そしてNEK!を通して、新たなファンの方ともたくさん出会う事ができ、
      今年はとても素敵な出会いをたくさんしました。
      
      2024年、
      今まで見ていてくれた方も、新たに巡り会えた方も
      支えて下さりありがとうございました！
      
      来年は更に大きなステージを目指して行くので、ついてきてください！！
      
      (伝えたいことを我武者羅に書いてみたから、上手くまとまってなかったり、読みにくかったらごめんね。)
      
      また2025年に会いましょうーー！
      良いお年を〜🎍
      みんな大好き！！！！

      12/29 "NEK! DEBUT YEAR LAST LIVE"
      @ Shimokitazawa Shangri-La
      
      Thank you for the final live of the year.
      I was surprised to see a view I couldn't have imagined back at our first live when my strap came off and I almost dropped my bass, and I was so happy I occasionally got a bit teary. lol
      (I'm such an idiot for making two composition mistakes and causing trouble for Hika-chan, even though I had the setlist at my feet.)
      
      And thank you for warmly watching over our activities throughout 2024.
      
      NEK! started on March 7, 2024, but before that, I was active on SNS by myself.
      Ever since I started playing bass in middle school, I've had one dream: "I want to be the reason someone starts playing bass."
      To make that dream come true, I had a great longing to perform in front of people.
      That's why I always strongly thought, "I want to form a band."
      Up until now, I tried my best to form a band, but sometimes things didn't work out.
      But I hated the idea of doing nothing just because I couldn't form a band, so I made up my mind to start my SNS activities.
      I started uploading videos, mainly "played-it" covers, and I was happy that the number of viewers gradually increased.
      
      As I worked hard, there were painful times when I worried too much about numbers and couldn't enjoy the bass I'm supposed to love.
      But I was able to keep going because there were people who gave me very warm and happy comments.
      Among them, some people said, "I started playing bass because of Kanade-san," and I was so happy that one dream came true through these activities.
      
      While working hard on SNS, the feeling that I wanted to deliver music directly, live, and standing on stage—not just through a camera—became even stronger, and I thought, "I really do want to be in a band."
      Just as I was thinking that, I met everyone in NEK!.
      NEK! is a group of members who met because of SNS, so I'm glad I worked hard on my activities until now.
      I look forward to our future together.
      
      I could only talk to those who always supported me through SNS comments before,
      so being able to actually meet and talk to you made me really, really happy.
      And through NEK!, I was able to meet many new fans,
      making this a year of so many wonderful encounters.
      
      In 2024,
      To those who have watched me until now, and to those I've newly met,
      thank you for supporting me!
      
      Next year, we are aiming for even bigger stages, so please follow us!!
      
      (I wrote what I wanted to say frantically, so I'm sorry if it's not well-summarized or hard to read.)
      
      See you all again in 2025!
      Have a happy New Year~🎍
      I love you all!!!!

      2024年、、今年ももう終わっちゃうね！
      
      まずは「NEK! DEBUT YEAR LAST LIVE」ありがとうございました！
      29日ということもあり、初めはNEK!を選んでくれた人はどれだけいるのだろうかと少し不安でした、
      でも、幕が開いてフロアを見るとたっっくさんのファンのみなさんが見えて、ほんっとに嬉しかったと同時に泣きそうになりました。
      きっとこの景色はこれからわたしがバンドを続けていく中で一生忘れられない景色になると思います。
      
      2024年は、長いようであっという間でした。
      人生が180度変わった1年。
      
      わたしはNEK!の活動が始まる前、バンドマンになるという夢を諦めかけていました。
      バンドは大好きだけどそれだけではうまく行かないことも多くて、だからNEK!に出会えたことは私にとって奇跡でした。
      
      MCでも少し話しましたが、初ライブのときは10人いるかいないかのフロアで、そこから約40回のライブを経て、シャングリラがパンパンになるまでのファンの皆様に出会うことができました。
      自分のバンドマンとしての足りなさに何度も何度も悩み、反省を繰り返し、そして落ち込むこともありました。
      でもそんな時にはいつもファンの皆様がそばにいて、優しく見守ってくださり、温かい言葉をかけて応援してくださいました。皆さまが私にとっての原動力になっていました。本当にありがとうございました。
      
      そして、この3人のバンドメンバーとバンドを組めて幸せでした！！
      3人とも魅力に溢れすぎていて、3人について書き出したらキリがないくらい素敵な人たちです。
      いつもありがとう🫶🏻
      
      幸せすぎた2024年でしたが、来年はみなさんと一緒にもっともっと最高な景色を見れたらいいなって思っています。
      私自身、本当に足りないところが多くギタリストとしてまだまだですが、これからもっともっとNEK!とともに高みを目指せるよう頑張ります🔥🔥🔥🔥
      NEK!の夢はまだ始まったばかり！
      2025年もよろしくお願いします！💛💛

      .
      2024... this year is already ending!
      
      First of all, thank you for "NEK! DEBUT YEAR LAST LIVE"!
      Since it was the 29th, I was a little anxious at first about how many people would choose NEK!,
      But when the curtain opened and I looked at the floor, I saw sooooo many fans, and I was so happy I almost cried.
      I'm sure this is a sight I'll never forget for the rest of my life as I continue being in a band.
      
      2024 felt long yet went by in a flash.
      A year where my life changed 180 degrees.
      
      Before NEK! started, I was about to give up on my dream of becoming a band member.
      I love bands, but there are many things that don't go well just with that alone, so finding NEK! was a miracle for me.
      
      As I mentioned a bit during the MC, at our first live show there were barely 10 people on the floor, and from there, through about 40 shows, I was able to meet enough fans to pack Shangri-La.
      I worried over and over again about my shortcomings as a band member, reflected repeatedly, and sometimes felt down.
      But in those times, the fans were always by my side, watching over me kindly and supporting me with warm words. You all were my driving force. Thank you so much.
      
      Also, I was so happy to be in a band with these three members!!
      All three are so full of charm that there's no end to it if I start writing about them; they are wonderful people.
      Thank you always 🫶🏻
      
      2024 was too happy, but I hope to see even more amazing sights together with everyone next year.
      Personally, I still have many shortcomings and a long way to go as a guitarist, but I will do my best to aim higher and higher together with NEK! from here on 🔥🔥🔥🔥
      NEK!'s dream has only just begun!
      Please look forward to 2025! 💛💛
