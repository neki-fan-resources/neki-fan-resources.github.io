      NEK!、初のワンマンツアー
      「TR!CK TAK!NG」無事完走することができました！
      ありがとうございました！
      大阪、愛知、東京と3日間巡ってまいりましたが
      本当に全て楽しかったです。
      各地にNEK!のファンの方がいて、楽しみに待っててくれて、、私たちの音楽が届いていることを実感してすごく嬉しかったです。
      
      そして昨日は最終日の東京。
      もうねー、フロアに集まってくださったパンッパンのお客さんを見て、初手で泣きそうになりました。（結局最後抑えきれなかったんだけど＾＾）
      
      率直に楽しかったァァ！！！！
      幸せでした。ほんとにずっと。
      
      正直、悔いはたくさんあるし、全てがうまくいったなんて思ってないです。
      色々と課題点はたくさんあったし、まだまだ頑張らなければいけないと感じる点はたくさんあって、発展途上の段階ではあります。
      
      それでも、総じて本当にわたしにとっては最高なツアーファイナルでした。
      みなさんのおかげで、そう思うことができます。
      煽ったらその何十倍の熱量で返してくれて、笑顔を向けたら、満面の笑みで返してくれて、、
      
      MCでも言ったけど、本当にNEK!のお客さんは温かくて最高だとこのツアーを通してより一層実感することができました。（みんなの温かい眼差しにやられそうになって、メンバー見て落ち着かせようと思ったらメンバーみんなの優しい微笑みで追い討ちかけられて見事に涙腺が）
      
      最高なメンバー、最高なスタッフさん、そして最高なお客さん、こんなに大好きに囲まれた環境でバンドができて、感謝しかないです。本当にありがとう。
      
      そして、今回のツアーファイナルでも発表ありましたが、8/30（日）にZepp Shinjukuでワンマンライブをします。
      バンドを結成した当初から幾度となく言ってきた「Zeppに立ちたい」というNEK!の夢。
      その夢の舞台です。
      挑戦の道にはなりますが、みなさんと最高な瞬間を迎えられたらと思っています。そのためにもわたし自身もこのZepp Shinjukuに本気で立ち向かいます。
      全力で挑みます。
      そして、その先の夢も皆様と一緒に見て行けたら嬉しいです！
      NEK!一同、お待ちしております🔥

      NEK!'s first one-man tour
      "TR!CK TAK!NG" has been successfully completed!
      Thank you so much!
      We traveled through Osaka, Aichi, and Tokyo over these 3 days
      and everything was truly fun.
      Having NEK! fans in every location waiting for us excitedly... I was so happy to feel that our music is reaching you.
      
      And yesterday was the final day in Tokyo.
      Man, seeing the floor packed tight with the audience, I almost cried from the very first step. (Though in the end, I couldn't hold it back at all ^^)
      
      To be honest, it was so much FUN!!!!
      I was happy. Truly, the whole time.
      
      Frankly, I have many regrets and I don't think everything went perfectly.
      There were many challenges and many points where I felt I still have to work much harder; we are still in a stage of development.
      
      Even so, overall, it was a truly amazing tour final for me.
      I can think that thanks to all of you.
      When I fired up the crowd, you gave it back with dozens of times more heat, and when I smiled at you, you gave back a huge grin...
      
      Like I said in the MC, through this tour I was able to feel even more deeply that NEK! fans are truly warm and the best. (I was about to lose it seeing everyone's warm gaze, and when I looked at the members to try and calm down, their gentle smiles dealt the finishing blow to my tear ducts)
      
      The best members, the best staff, and the best audience—I have nothing but gratitude to be able to be in a band surrounded by an environment I love so much. Thank you truly.
      
      And as announced at this tour final, we will hold a one-man live at Zepp Shinjuku on 8/30 (Sun).
      NEK!'s dream of "wanting to stand at Zepp" is something we've said countless times since we formed the band.
      That's the stage for that dream.
      It will be a challenging path, but I hope to reach that greatest moment with all of you. To that end, I will seriously face this Zepp Shinjuku head-on.
      I will give it my absolute all.
      And I'd be happy if we could continue seeing the dreams beyond that together with everyone!
      All of us in NEK! are waiting for you🔥

      NEK! 1stワンマンツアー「TR!CK TAK!NG」
      名阪、そしてファイナル東京Spotify O-WEST
      
      3日間ありがとうございました！！
      
      バテ気味でMC上手くまとまらなかったので、ここに綴らせてください。
      
      初めてのワンマンツアーということで、NEK!達みんな全力で今回の準備をしました。
      もちろん今までのワンマンも色々練って、みんなを楽しませられるようにと準備をしていました が、
      私含めメンバー全員とても気合いが入っておりました。
      
      8日、9日の名阪、もちろんライブは楽しかったんだけど、
      たくさんの反省点もあって、バンドマンとしての自分を見つめ直しました。
      「どうしたらもっとみんなを楽しませられるかな。」
      「これでいいのかな。こんなんじゃ人前に立てないよ。」
      
      16日を迎えるまで、ライブ直前まで
      ずっと不安でいっぱいでした。
      
      (Xに乗っけてる浮かれポンチな写真も撮ってたけど、ああでもしてテンション上げてないと緊張と不安で押しつぶされそうだった。笑)
      
      これまで一生懸命準備もしてきたし、いっぱい努力もしてきたから
      頑張ってるのは本当なんだけど
      
      心の隅っこで「まだ努力し足りないし頑張り不足だし。」ってずっと思ってて。
      
      とにかく不安でいっぱいでした！！！！！
      
      でもライブが始まって、NEK!の為に集まってくれたみんなを見て
      そんなの全部吹き飛びました。
      
      とにかく今自分ができる全力をだして、みんなを楽しませよう！と意気込めました。
      
      私自身今までで1番楽しいライブになったし、パフォーマンスも満足いったし、
      1枚目の笑顔で大ジャンプしてる写真が物語ってるでしょ🤭
      
      みんなのおかげで無事ファイナルを終えることができて、成長もできて、
      本当に良いツアーになりました。
      
      
      3日間、NEK!はじめてのツアーを支えてくださったみなさん
      本当に本当にありがとうございました！
      
      みんながいるから、今の私がいます！
      
      次のワンマンはベースを始めた中学生の頃から、ずぅーーーーっと憧れていたZeppです。
      正直、私の心はまったく追いついてなくて、
      本当にこんな私がZeppに立つの？って感じです。
      
      今回のツアー以上に不安で押しつぶされそうになると思うけど、
      心のどこかで、かなでん負けるなって応援しててくださいお願いします😂
      
      これからもベーシストKanadeをよろしくね。
      
      (P.S.もっと良い文章が書きたいです、そこも含めて成長見守ってね👶🍼)

      NEK! 1st One-man Tour "TR!CK TAK!NG"
      Nagoya, Osaka, and the Final at Tokyo Spotify O-WEST
      
      Thank you so much for the 3 days!!
      
      I was a bit exhausted and couldn't wrap up my MC very well, so please let me write it here.
      
      Since it was our first one-man tour, all of us in NEK! put everything into the preparations this time.
      Of course, we've always carefully planned our previous one-man shows to make sure everyone enjoys them,
      but all the members, including myself, were extremely fired up.
      
      The 8th and 9th in Nagoya and Osaka were, of course, fun lives,
      but there were also many points to reflect on, and I re-evaluated myself as a band member.
      "How can I make everyone enjoy it even more?"
      "Is this okay? I can't stand in front of people like this."
      
      Until the 16th arrived, and right up until the live started,
      I was constantly filled with anxiety.
      
      (I was taking those goofy "high-spirit" photos I posted on X, but if I hadn't done that to pump myself up, I felt like I would've been crushed by the tension and anxiety. lol)
      
      I've been preparing desperately and putting in a lot of effort,
      so it's true that I'm working hard, but
      
      In a corner of my heart, I kept thinking, "My effort still isn't enough, I'm not working hard enough."
      
      Anyway, I was just full of anxiety!!!!!
      
      But once the live started and I saw everyone who gathered for NEK!,
      all of that just blew away.
      
      I felt inspired to just give everything I can right now and make everyone have a great time!
      
      It became the most fun live I've ever had, and I was satisfied with my performance;
      I think that first photo of me doing a big jump with a smile says it all 🤭
      
      Thanks to everyone, we were able to finish the final safely and grow,
      it really became a great tour.
      
      
      To everyone who supported NEK!'s first tour over these 3 days,
      thank you so very, very much!
      
      Because you are here, the "me" of today exists!
      
      The next one-man is at Zepp, a place I've dreamed of ever since I started playing bass in middle school.
      To be honest, my heart hasn't caught up at all,
      and I'm like, "Is someone like me really going to stand on the Zepp stage?"
      
      I think I'll be even more crushed by anxiety than I was for this tour,
      but please cheer for me somewhere in your heart, like "Kanaden, don't lose!" 😂
      
      Please continue to support bassist Kanade.
      
      (P.S. I want to write better posts; please watch over my growth in that area too 👶🍼)

      NEK!初の東名阪ワンマンツアー 「TR!CK TAK!NG」
      ツアーファイナルの東京公演が昨日無事終演いたしました〜！！🎉
      
      お足元の悪い中お越しくださった皆様本当にありがとうございました！寒かったけど、私たちの音で暖まれましたかね？
      
      大阪愛知と回ってきて(またそれぞれのレポも書くね)、どこも甲乙つけがたいほどの盛り上がりっぷりを見せてくれて、最高にアツいツアーとなりました🔥
      
      大阪も愛知も前回訪れたときよりもお客さんが増えたし、曲中の歓声とかコーラスも比べ物にならないくらい大きくなっていて、NEK!の輪が広がっているのをひしひしと実感しました。昨日はお子さんも来てくれてて嬉しかったな☺️
      
      そんな激アツなツアーを締めくくる昨日の東京公演。
      登場SEが流れて順番的に私がいちばん最初にステージに上がったのですが、ソールドアウトした満員のフロアが目に飛び込んできた瞬間、わー！！と驚きを隠せませんでした🫢💥
      お立ち台に立ったときになにかポーズ決めたりしようかな〜と直前までは思っていたけど、嬉しさで頭真っ白になっちゃって、結局なにもできなかった…！笑
      
      ここにいる全員に、今日来てよかったな。NEK!ってやっぱりかっこいいな。と思いながら帰ってもらえるような演奏をお届けしよう！！と意を決してドラムに向かいました。
      
      今作リード曲のzero-sumから始まり、今回のツアーから披露している新曲もいくつかやらせていただいて、そして途中のアコースティックコーナーではGt.のNatsuはアコギに持ち替え、私はカホンにチェンジして特別バージョンのLonerと令現少女をお届けしました。
      
      MCでも話したように、NEK!の楽曲は音数が多くてテンポも速くて激しい楽曲が多いので、なかなかアコースティックバージョンにアレンジするのが難しいこともあるのですが、どんどんレパートリー増やしていけたらなと思っているので、今後も楽しみにしててくださいね💫
      
      後半はもう休む暇もなくブチアゲソングの連発で、汗だくになりながら会場一帯となって楽しめてめちゃめちゃ嬉しかったです！
      
      Lonerの大合唱とかDreams!!!!のoh oh!とか挙げたらキリがないけど、本当に皆さんの声が大きくてやばかった！笑
      これは負けてられんぞ…！と思いながら私もハートを燃やして頑張りました😂❤️‍🔥
      ファンとプレイヤーの相乗効果で最高の空間が生まれ、そのまま本編は終了！
      
      zero-sumでアンコールが始まり、MCでは今年の8/30に行うZepp Shinjukuでのワンマンライブを解禁させていただき、興奮冷めやらぬままNEK!の始まりの曲Get Overで幕を閉じました⚡️
      
      Zepp Shinjuku、やばいでしょ？
      
      このバンドを始めるまでは、Zeppでワンマンライブをやりますとステージ上で発表する日が来るとは思ってもいなかったので、心の底から込み上げてくる嬉しさと、発表を聞いて喜んでくれている皆さんの姿を見て、感極まりながらGet Overを演奏しました🥲
      
      結成してまだ1年半も経たない私たちがZeppなんてまだ早いんじゃないか？と、本当に埋められるのか？と、皆さんに思われることは十分理解しています。
      
      でも、そういう人たちにそんな心配いらなかったねと笑ってもらえるくらいの景色を8月30日に必ず見せます。
      昨日、フロア一面に広がった無数の笑顔を見てNEK!ならできると確信しました。
      
      ですが、確実に易々と越えられるような壁ではないから、死ぬ気で努力しないといけないということもわかっています。
      個人としてもバンドとしても今のままではいけない。
      
      ライブの本数は去年よりも少ないですが、日々SNSなどを通して皆さんにいろんな形で"想い"をお届けするので、ぜひこれからも見守っていただけたら幸いです。
      
      NEK!という4人の少女達がまたひとつ大きな夢を叶える姿を目撃しに来てください。
      
      このタイミングでこんな素敵な挑戦をさせてくれる周りの環境に心から感謝しつつ、これからも精進して参ります🔥
      
      昨日は本当にありがとうございました！！！！

      NEK!'s first East-Mei-Han one-man tour "TR!CK TAK!NG"
      The tour final Tokyo performance successfully concluded yesterday!! 🎉
      
      Thank you so much to everyone who came despite the bad weather! It was cold, but did our sound warm you up?
      
      Traveling through Osaka and Aichi (I'll write reports for each of those too), every location showed an excitement that was hard to rank, making it an incredibly hot tour🔥
      
      The number of audience members in both Osaka and Aichi increased compared to our last visits, and the cheers and choruses during the songs grew incomparably louder; I keenly felt that the NEK! circle is expanding. I was also happy to see children coming yesterday ☺️
      
      Yesterday's Tokyo performance concluded such a high-intensity tour.
      The entrance SE played and, following the order, I was the first to step onto the stage; the moment the sight of the sold-out, packed floor hit my eyes, I couldn't hide my surprise—Whoa!! 🫢💥
      Until right before, I thought about doing a pose when I stood on the platform, but my mind went blank with joy and I ended up doing nothing...! lol
      
      I sat at my drums with the determination to deliver a performance that would make everyone here think, "I'm glad I came today" and "NEK! really is cool," as they head home!!
      
      Starting with this work's lead track "zero-sum," we performed several new songs debuted during this tour, and during the acoustic corner in the middle, Gt. Natsu switched to acoustic guitar and I changed to cajon to deliver special versions of "Loner" and "Reigen Shoujo."
      
      As mentioned in the MC, many of NEK!'s songs have many notes, fast tempos, and are intense, so it can be difficult to arrange them into acoustic versions, but I hope to keep increasing our repertoire, so please look forward to it in the future💫
      
      The second half was a continuous barrage of hype songs with no time to rest, and I was so happy to enjoy it with the whole venue as one while getting drenched in sweat!
      
      The "Loner" sing-along, the "oh oh!" in "Dreams!!!!"—there's no end to the list, but your voices were truly loud and crazy! lol
      Thinking "I can't let them beat me...!", I worked hard with my heart burning too😂❤️‍🔥
      The synergy between fans and players created the best space, and the main set ended just like that!
      
      The encore began with "zero-sum," and during the MC, we announced our one-man live at Zepp Shinjuku on 8/30 of this year. With the excitement still lingering, we closed the curtain with NEK!'s starting song, "Get Over"⚡️
      
      Zepp Shinjuku, isn't that crazy?
      
      Until I started this band, I never thought the day would come when I'd announce on stage that we're doing a one-man live at Zepp. Feeling joy welling up from the bottom of my heart and seeing everyone happy to hear the announcement, I played "Get Over" while feeling overwhelmed with emotion🥲
      
      I fully understand that people might think, "Isn't it too early for Zepp when it hasn't even been a year and a half since they formed?" or "Can they really fill it?"
      
      However, I will definitely show everyone a view on August 30th that will make those people laugh and say there was no need to worry.
      Seeing the countless smiles spread across the floor yesterday, I am convinced that NEK! can do it.
      
      But I also know that it's certainly not a wall that can be easily overcome, so we must work to the death.
      As an individual and as a band, we cannot stay as we are now.
      
      While we have fewer live shows than last year, we will deliver our "feelings" to you in various forms through SNS every day, so I would be grateful if you would continue to watch over us.
      
      Please come and witness the moment these four girls called NEK! fulfill another big dream.
      
      While feeling heartfelt gratitude toward the environment around us that allows us to take on such a wonderful challenge at this timing, I will continue to devote myself🔥
      
      Thank you truly for yesterday!!!!

      2025.03.16 TOKYO Spotify O-WEST
      
      3/8 OSAKA DROP
      3/9 AICHI R.A.D
      
      NEK!'s first Tokyo-Nagoya-Osaka one-man tour "TR!CK TAK!NG"
      
      Truly, fun times go by in the blink of an eye!
      Thank you so much for these 3 days!
      
      There's a fun and scenery different from before I met NEK!
      I feel like my dreams are coming true one by one.
      To everyone who always supports NEK!,
      I am truly full of gratitude.
      
      Thank you.
      
      And, what we told everyone on the final day—
      the place that is both a dream and a milestone,
      a one-man live at Zepp Shinjuku.
      
      A scene where we can hold our heads high and say this is who we are,
      and a live show that will definitely give a little push to the backs
      of everyone who always supports us.
      
      Please continue to support NEK! as we keep evolving!
      See you at Zepp Shinjuku!
