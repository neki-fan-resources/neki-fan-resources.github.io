  description:
  - Drawing on the metaphor of 'marine snow,' the song expresses the idea that abandoned dreams are never truly lost. Just as marine snow sustains life in the deep ocean, the passions we put aside sink into our depths to nourish new inspiration, becoming the foundation for renewed dreams as our journey continues.
