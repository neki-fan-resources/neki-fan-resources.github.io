  - Hika and Natsu were guest of the show 'FANTASY RADIO' on NACK5.
  - >
    The interview went over the general band info, then they spoke about the music of 'zero-sum'.
    In second part, the host did an analysis of the lyrics of 'Loner', 'moon' and 'Fool'.
  - "'zero-sum' and 'Dreams!!!!' were played during the program."

  # TODO: add a summary of the interview

# --- my comment on Discord
# Got a few more details using LLM transcription and translation.
# They spoke quickly about the band creation (Hika looking for people to create a band, and finding Natsu "a cute girl doing shredding")  and song writing (jamming together, then additional help to finish the songs).
# In the second part, the host is not speaking about zero-sum. She is doing a quick lyrics analysis of Loner, then moon, then Fool. It seems that they resonate a lot with her personal experience (she is a pro wrestler and radio host).
# The host is either a great host, or a big fan (or both).
